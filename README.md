# The ARG I made because **fuck you**
just follow the clues and find the codes. btw i write shitty html so be careful looking through it. most stuff can be found without looking at it, but reading the html can speed some stuff up. there's nothing actually preventing you though so if you really want to stare at HTML for 10 hours go ahead. another rule that I'm not actually enforcing but would appreciate is if you wouldn't just try to bruteforce stuff the whole time, and instead actually solve the puzzles. also if you don't read the lore and just skip through the puzzles ill fucking shoot you. but there's zero rules for this, and stuff will be spread all over the internet. if you think there's just a tiny tiny chance that something might be a clue or a place you can find a clue, i would reccomend checking it. the ending gives you a code to DM me, first to do that gets a special prize and everyone else that does gets a different prize. idk what they are yet though.
